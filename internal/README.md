The `internal` directory will contain the various ancillary packages used by our API. It will contain the code for interacting with our database, doing data validation, sending emails and so on. Basically, any code which isn't application-specific and can potentially be reused will live in here. Our go code under `cmd/api` will import the packages in the `internal` directory (but never the other way around).
